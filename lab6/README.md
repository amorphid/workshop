# Lab6

## Lab purpose

In the previous lab, you put each room in its own process. 
In Lab 6, each user will be in its own process, and we'll send messages with 
an eactual Elixir intraprocess message. We'll finally make use of the `id` fields
we added to each member. 

## Lab instructions

As usual, in the directory `lab6`, you'll see a file called `lib/lab6.ex` with 
several stubbed out functions. You can run your tests using `mix test`, and 
implement the stubbed out functions until all of your tests pass.
