# Lab6

### Lab purpose

In this lab we will further expand on the chat room to add message sending and
broadcast functionality.


### Lab instructions

Create a new mix project with `mix new lab6`.

The `lab6` directory has a file `lib/lab6.ex` which contains an implementation of chat
room with some stubbed out functions. Copy the file to `lib/` in your project and
implement the functions.

  1. Implement the `send/4` function.

  2. Implement the `broadcast/3` function.
